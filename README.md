## Install
On command line:
```
apm install jumpy-beacon
```

## Notes

*   Works great with or without [Jumpy](https://atom.io/packages/jumpy).
*   I accidentally stumbled on this idea while I was first developing the beacon for [Jumpy](https://atom.io/packages/jumpy) a few years ago!

## Config Settings

None yet!

## Jumpy-Beacon Styles

Just override the `.jumpy-beacon` class from [beacon.less](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidLGoldberg/jumpy-beacon/master/styles/beacon.less)

*Note*: Styles can be overridden in **'Atom' -> 'Stylesheet...'**

## My other Atom packages :)

*   [Jumpy](https://atom.io/packages/jumpy)
*   [Qolor](https://atom.io/packages/qolor)
